## ðŸ”¹ Project Story:

- **Situation**:  
  The company was working with **50+ vendors**, but vendor data was scattered across Excel files and manual reports. Leadership struggled to identify which suppliers were profitable, which were underperforming, and how vendor choices impacted the bottom line.  

- **Task**:  
  Build an **end-to-end analytics pipeline** to consolidate data, measure vendor performance, and present insights in a **single interactive dashboard** for decision-makers.  

- **Action**:  
  - Designed an **ETL pipeline** using **SQL + Python (Pandas)** to clean and merge data from multiple sources (~**100k+ transaction records**).  
  - Developed **10+ key KPIs**, including **Total Sales, Gross Profit, Profit Margin, Inventory Turnover, Bulk Purchase Savings**, etc.  
  - Automated creation of a **Vendor Summary Table** with SQL queries, improving report generation speed by **80%**.  
  - Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** featuring:  
    - **Top 10 vendors by sales & margin** (bar charts)  
    - **Low-margin vendors** (highlighted with conditional formatting)  
    - **Inventory value & turnover analysis** (cards + tables)  
    - **Year-over-year trend analysis** (line charts)  

- **Result**:  
  - Identified **15% of vendors causing negative margins**, leading to **â‚¹25L (~$30k) annual cost savings** after renegotiations.  
  - Improved inventory planning efficiency by **20%**, reducing excess stock with low-turnover vendors.  
  - Replaced manual monthly Excel reporting with an **automated daily refresh**, saving **15+ analyst hours/month**.  
  - Gave leadership a **single source of truth**, enabling faster and more confident vendor decisions.
